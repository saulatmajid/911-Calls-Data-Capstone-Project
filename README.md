# 911-Calls-Data-Capstone-Project
This is a Udemy project designed by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science, Pierian Data Inc. and uses 911 Calls Dataset from Kaggle.

This project is based on the analysis on 911 call data, from Kaggle. Here, the dataset is analyzed and data visualization is done using Seaborne. 
Dataframe is created using the csv file, and after initial data exploration certain questions about the dataset are answered. On the same dataframe new features are created and then data visualization is done with Seaborne. Barplots, countplots, line graphs, heatmaps are used to visualize patterns. Overall, a straightforward project!
